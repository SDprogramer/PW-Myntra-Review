import requests # Request the webpages
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs # To pass html content
from selenium import webdriver # Automate browser
# Web driver -> Handle chrome web browser
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By # By class is imported

get method => loads a webpage into current browser session
rawQuery => what is the string we are searching for
html.parser =>  
Initialise driver, ask driver open chrome, go to particular url, ask driver extract entire page source

ctrl + shift + c => inspect page
all products are in unordered list class result base
fetch text of only first product
find all => will find ul class named result base in the entire webpage
pclass[0] => fetch entire webpage and only select 1st product

for i in pclass:
    href = i.find_all('a', href = True) => find all the anchor tags
    t = (href[0]['href']) => only 1st product
"https://www.myntra.com/" + t => storing the url link
a => anchor tag => contains the hyperlink reference url of the product

getting to product link and opening the one single product

extracting the title by inspect webpage

prodRes_html.findAll("div", {"class" : "index-overallRating"}) => 
find all div with class name index-overallRating 

we only need 4.1 data and discard all others so we use for loop
i.find the div as a text and then print

find all span with class name pdp-price 

we only need 1246 data and discard all others so we use for loop
i the span as a text and then print


without only single review we will go to the all detailed reviews page
find specific anchor tag with class name detailed-reviews-allReviews

t2 = Reviews['href'] => copying the href text from Reviews to t2
Review_link = 'https://www.myntra.com' + t2 => and creating a customised url of the review page

get to the review_link and open the driver page source

driver.quit() => close the application
